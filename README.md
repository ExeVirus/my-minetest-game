# my-minetest-game
**NOTE**: name is still TBD

This is a procedurally generated space exploration game, inspired by No Man's
Sky and other similar tiles, but built around voxel mechanics. It features an
immensely large universe with a never-ending variety of planets to explore.

**NOTE**: choose *singlenode* as mapgen type.

## Status
For now, 16 different planets' surfaces are generated next to each other. Blocks
include stone, gravel, dust, sediment and liquid. Planets of different colors,
rockier, more hilly or flat, and richer in oceans are generated. World
generation features oceans and caves. Currently working on making caves more
complex, while keeping them balanced and diverse.

The game is not yet playable, as it does not include any user-interaction code.

## TODO
 * Finish basic cave generation
 * Add basic vegetation
 * Add minerals and ores
 * Add player mechanics
 * Add basic items
 * Add basic crafting
 * Add spacecraft building
 * Add flight
 * Add interplanetary space
 * Add interstellar travel
 * Improve all of the above
