# my-minetest-game
**NOTE**: name is still TBD

This is a procedurally generated space exploration game, inspired by No Man's
Sky and other similar titles, but built around voxel mechanics. It features an
immensely large universe with a never-ending variety of planets to explore.

**NOTE**: choose *singlenode* as mapgen type.

## Status
For now, 16 different planets' surfaces are generated next to each other. Blocks
include stone, gravel, dust, sediment, liquid and grass soil. Planets of
different colors, rockier, more hilly or flat, and richer in oceans are
generated. World generation features oceans and caves.

The next step is adding basic climate types and vegetation.

The game is not yet playable, as it does not include any user-interaction code.

## TODO
 * Add basic vegetation
 * Add minerals and ores
 * Add player mechanics
 * Add basic items
 * Add basic crafting
 * Add spacecraft building
 * Add flight
 * Add interplanetary space
 * Add interstellar travel
 * Improve all of the above

## Contributing
The code is made to be as self-documenting as possible. Just go into the `mods`
directory and read the `init.lua` file within a mod. It should present the API
exported by the mod, if any, and gently guide the reader through the code
itself.
